# Animal Shelter Database: A Client/Server Application
## Developed by Adam Sissoko

### Introduction
This repository contains a client-server application aimed at managing an Animal Shelter Database. The project is built in Python and integrates MongoDB for backend data storage. The frontend is designed using Plotly and Dash to provide an interactive user interface.

---

### Features

#### Backend
- **MongoDB**: Used for data storage, offering a flexible NoSQL solution.
- **CRUD Operations**: The backend supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for database interactions.
- **Query Optimization**: Indexing methods have been employed for efficient data retrieval.

#### Frontend
- **Data Visualization**: Incorporates Plotly for interactive data representation.
- **User Interface**: The Dash framework has been used for creating an interactive frontend.
- **Data Filtering**: The UI allows for real-time data filtering based on predefined categories like "Water Rescue", "Mountain Rescue", and "Disaster Rescue".

#### Code and Architecture
- **Modular Approach**: The code is organized in a way that allows for easier maintenance and scalability.
- **Code Quality**: Attention has been paid to writing readable and maintainable code.
