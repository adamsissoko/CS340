<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to my repository, a showcase of my expertise in client/server development with a focus on database management. This compilation contains multiple projects that collectively offer a deep dive into CRUD operations, real-time data manipulation, and user interface design, all built to interact efficiently with databases.
</p>

<h3>Technical Stack</h3>
<p>
  The projects in this repository mainly utilize the following technologies and languages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>Plotly</li>
  <li>Dash</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Project: Animal Shelter Database</h3>
<p>
  In this cornerstone project, a MongoDB database is constructed, optimized with multiple indexes to accelerate query performance. CRUD operations are made possible through a Python backend, while the front-end user interface is crafted using a combination of Python, Plotly, and Dash.
</p>

<h3>Project Highlights</h3>
<p> 
  The application features are delineated as follows:
</p>
<h3>Main List</h3>
<p>
  The screenshot below provides a detailed view of the main list feature of the application. This main list showcases a comprehensive catalogue of animal entries stored in the shelter's database. The entries are fully sortable by various headings such as type, age, and breed, allowing users an unparalleled degree of flexibility. You can perform CRUD operations in real-time, meaning that the entries can be edited or deleted instantaneously. The feature also comes with a filter option for specific task-based queries like Water Rescue, Mountain Rescue, and Disaster Rescue.

<h3>Interactive Histogram</h3>
<p>
  The second image showcases the interactive histogram feature of the application. This histogram is designed to auto-update in real-time, reflecting any changes in the animal's birth dates stored in the database. The feature is particularly insightful when the list is filtered to show specific groups. It serves as an analytical tool for understanding the age distribution of the animals in the shelter, aiding in data-driven decision-making.

<h3>Interactive Map and Histogram</h3>
<p>
  This image demonstrates a complex feature combining both a map and a histogram. The feature is designed to update simultaneously based on the selected group filters, offering a cohesive experience. The map is highly interactive, supporting features like zooming and panning to offer geographical context about the locations of each of the animals listed in the database. Coupled with the histogram, this feature allows users to visualize both the spatial distribution and the demographic details of the animals.

<h3>Site Interactivity</h3>
<p>
  The animated GIF below illustrates the high level of interactivity built into the site. In this animation, you can observe how selecting a specific category, such as "Water Rescue," triggers an immediate update across the entire list and all accompanying visual elements. This real-time responsiveness is one of the key attributes that make the application user-friendly, offering a seamless experience when navigating through various data visualizations and lists.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  This repository serves as a testament to the skills and concepts mastered in client/server development. It demonstrates a proficiency in database operations, interactivity, and responsive design. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work, and I invite you to delve into the code to discover its intricacies further.
