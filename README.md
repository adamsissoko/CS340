<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to my repository showcasing various client/server development projects! These projects were challenging but also incredibly rewarding. They emphasize the importance of databases in modern computing, serving as the backbone for a variety of applications. You'll find here code that handles CRUD operations, interfaces with databases, and even designs user interfaces for easier data navigation.
</p>

<p>
  To see the culmination of my learning, check out the <a href="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS340/blob/main/Python%20Mongo%20Tests/ModuleSixMilestone_AAC.py" target="_blank">Final Project file</a>. The README file will give you information about how to install and run the program (Python is required), and you'll need to set up a MongoDB server either locally or on Atlas.

<h3>Final Project: Animal Shelter Database</h3>
<p>
  For this project, I developed a MongoDB database, optimized with various indexes to assist with search queries. A CRUD module was developed in Python to access the database, and a user interface was designed using Python, Plotly, and Dash for easier database interaction.
</p>

<h3>Project Highlights</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>Main List</h3>
      <p>The database design showcases a main list of animals from the shelter, sortable by each heading. Entries can be deleted or edited in real-time. Users can also filter the list based on specific groups such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Water Rescue</li>
        <li>Mountain Rescue</li>
        <li>Disaster Rescue</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>Interactive Histogram</h3>
      <p>This histogram auto-updates to reflect the birth dates of the animals listed, especially when the list is filtered for specific groups.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS340/blob/main/images/03.png" alt="[bottom]" style="width:600px;"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>Interactive Map and Histogram</h3>
      <p>The Histogram and map update based on the selected groups from the list. The map can be zoomed to show the locations of each of the animals from the database.</p>

  <tr>
    <td><h3>Site Interactivity</h3>
      <p>The animation below demonstrates the interactivity of the list. For instance, selecting "Water Rescue" filters the list and updates the visualizations accordingly.</p>
