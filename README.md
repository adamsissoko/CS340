<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to my repository, a showcase of my expertise in client/server development with a focus on database management. This compilation contains multiple projects that collectively offer a deep dive into CRUD operations, real-time data manipulation, and user interface design, all built to interact efficiently with databases.
</p>
<h3>Technical Stack</h3>
<p>
  The projects in this repository mainly utilize the following technologies and languages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>Plotly</li>
  <li>Dash</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Project: Animal Shelter Database</h3>
<p>
  In this cornerstone project, a MongoDB database is constructed, optimized with multiple indexes to accelerate query performance. CRUD operations are made possible through a Python backend, while the front-end user interface is crafted using a combination of Python, Plotly, and Dash.
</p>
<h3>Project Highlights</h3>
<p> 
  The application features are delineated as follows:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>Main List</h3>
      <p>The first image showcases the main list of animals from the shelter. The list is sortable by various parameters, such as name and type. Each entry is editable and deletable in real-time, providing dynamic interaction. Filters have been added to sort the list based on specialized categories, like Water Rescue, Mountain Rescue, and Disaster Rescue, making it easier for users to find specific animals.</p>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS340/blob/main/images/01.png" alt="[Main List]" style="width:600px;"></td>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>Interactive Histogram</h3>
      <p>The second image displays an interactive histogram that updates in real-time as the user interacts with the main list. The histogram serves as a graphical representation of the birth dates of the animals. It’s particularly useful for visualizing demographic distributions within specific categories or when the list is filtered.</p>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS340/blob/main/images/03.png" alt="[Interactive Histogram]" style="width:600px;"></td>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>Interactive Map and Histogram</h3>
      <p>The third image showcases both an interactive histogram and a geographical map. The features are designed to sync in real-time, updating based on the filters applied in the main list. The map, which can be panned and zoomed, pinpoints the locations of animals, providing a geographical context that complements the histogram.</p>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS340/blob/main/images/02.png" alt="[Interactive Map and Histogram]" style="width:600px;"></td>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>Site Interactivity</h3>
      <p>The final animated image reveals the website’s seamless interactivity. Selecting a filter category like "Water Rescue" instantly refines the list, the histogram, and the map. This animation encapsulates the fluid user experience designed into the application, highlighting the real-time updates that occur across multiple components.</p>
      <td><img src="https://github.com/adamsissoko/CS340/blob/main/images/aac-min.gif" alt="[Site Interactivity]" style="width:600px;"></td>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  This repository serves as a testament to the skills and concepts mastered in client/server development. It demonstrates a proficiency in database operations, interactivity, and responsive design. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work, and I invite you to delve into the code to discover its intricacies further.
