# Animal Shelter Database Application

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for my Animal Shelter Database application. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my capabilities in client/server development, database management, and UI design. Built using Python, MongoDB, Plotly, and Dash, the application offers an intuitive user interface for interacting with an extensive animal shelter database.

## Features

### Main List

The application's main feature is a sortable and editable list that displays animals currently housed in the shelter.

The list offers real-time filtering based on various rescue categories:

- Water Rescue
- Mountain Rescue
- Disaster Rescue

### Interactive Histogram

This histogram dynamically displays the animals' birth dates and updates in real-time based on the selected rescue category or the filtered list.

### Interactive Map

A map in the application shows the geographical locations of the animals, adjusting according to the selected rescue category.
