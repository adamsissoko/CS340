# Animal Shelter Database: A Client/Server Application
## Developed by Adam Sissoko

### Introduction
This repository contains a client-server application designed to manage an Animal Shelter Database. Developed in Python, the project integrates with MongoDB for data storage and employs Plotly and Dash for the frontend user interface. This application showcases robust database design, CRUD operations, dynamic data visualization, and real-time UI interactivity.
